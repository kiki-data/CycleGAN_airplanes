# CycleGAN_airplanes

This simple training project was developed directly from https://github.com/MingtaoGuo/CycleGAN so visit that link for background and references. I included 100 airplane images here, but if you would like additional images I retrieved them from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/.

You will need to install tensorflow, numpy, scipy, and pillow.

Copy notebook and X and Y images. Create fake_X and fake_Y folders for output images. As you run the notebook, fake images populate. The video shows the output of an initial test progression with anime images, the progression from airplane images, and a final anime plus airplane combined image.

Once you run this once, you may get an error about a .DS_store file when you run it again. To delete using the Terminal: https://macpaw.com/how-to/remove-ds-store-files-on-mac

Cleaned anime face images were accessed through https://github.com/jayleicn/animeGAN.
