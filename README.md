# CycleGAN_airplanes

This simple training project was developed directly from https://github.com/MingtaoGuo/CycleGAN so visit that link for background and references. Airplane images used from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/.

You will need to install tensorflow, numpy, scipy, and pillow.

Copy notebook and X and Y images. Create fake_X and fake_Y folders for output images. As you run notebook, fake images populate.

Once you run this once, you may get an error about .DS_store file below when you run it again. This is how to delete (https://macpaw.com/how-to/remove-ds-store-files-on-mac).
